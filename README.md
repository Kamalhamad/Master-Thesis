# Sentiment Analysis and Recommender System Thesis

Welcome to the repository for my thesis on Sentiment Analysis and Recommender Systems. This research focuses on utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze customer reviews and enhance recommendation systems. Below, you'll find an overview of the project's structure and contents.

## Introduction
This thesis explores the integration of sentiment analysis techniques with recommender systems. By analyzing customer reviews, the goal is to improve the accuracy and personalization of product recommendations. The study investigates various Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to extract sentiment and insights from customer feedback.

## Conceptual Framework
The research is based on a conceptual framework comprising data preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and application of NLP techniques. The sentiment-based recommender system is designed to leverage user sentiment towards products for generating more accurate and personalized recommendations.

## Methodology
### Data Collection
- Description of the Dataset: Utilized the Amazon Customer Reviews (ACRS) dataset containing over 142 million reviews for over 13 million products.
- Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, cleaned review texts, performed lemmatization, and engineered additional features.
- Sentiment Analysis: Trained machine learning models (SVM, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees) to classify sentiments in customer reviews.

## Results
- Conducted exploratory data analysis, finding a strong correlation between sentiment scores and star ratings.
- Implemented a sentiment-based recommender system that outperformed baseline systems in terms of MAE and RMSE metrics.

## Conclusion
The study validates the effectiveness of sentiment analysis in enhancing recommender systems. The sentiment-based approach significantly improves recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction.
