Sentiment-Based Recommender System Documentation
Overview
This project implements a hybrid recommender system that combines sentiment analysis and collaborative filtering to provide personalized product recommendations. The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze customer reviews and extract sentiment information. This documentation provides an overview of the system's functionality, components, and usage instructions.

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd sentiment-based-recommender
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Sentiment Analysis
The sentiment_analysis.py module provides functions to train a sentiment analysis model and predict sentiment scores for customer reviews.

Usage:

python
Copy code
from sentiment_analysis import train_sentiment_analysis_model, predict_sentiment

# Load the ACRS dataset (ACRS.csv should be in the same directory)
acrs_df = pd.read_csv('ACRS.csv')

# Train sentiment analysis model
sentiment_clf, sentiment_vectorizer = train_sentiment_analysis_model(acrs_df)

# Predict sentiment for a review
user_review = "This product is amazing!"
sentiment = predict_sentiment(sentiment_clf, sentiment_vectorizer, user_review)
print("Sentiment:", sentiment)
Collaborative Filtering
The collaborative_filtering.py module provides functions to build a collaborative filtering recommendation system.

Usage:

python
Copy code
from collaborative_filtering import build_recommendation_system, recommend_products

# Build recommendation system
recommendation_knn, recommendation_vectorizer = build_recommendation_system(acrs_df)

# Get recommendations based on a user's review
user_review = "This product is amazing!"
recommended_products = recommend_products(recommendation_knn, recommendation_vectorizer, user_review)
print("Recommended Products:", recommended_products)
Components
Sentiment Analysis
The sentiment analysis component uses a logistic regression classifier trained on customer reviews to predict sentiment scores (ranging from -1 to 1). It processes textual data to determine the sentiment of the input.

Collaborative Filtering
The collaborative filtering component employs the k-nearest neighbors algorithm to find similar reviews based on TF-IDF vectors. It recommends products by identifying reviews with similar sentiments and content.
